All matter consists of volume and mass.
Physical and chemical properties help classify matter.
While the physical property doesn't change the matter, the chemical property changes the matter creating new substances.
Different types of matter that can be observed are, animals, bikes, trees, dust mites, and air, which are just examples of matter.
All matter also consists of energy.
The law of conservation of energy describes how even though energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can be transferred from one object to another.
There are two different types of mechanical energy is kinetic energy and potential energy.
The kinetic energy takes up the energy of a moving object, while the potential takes up the energy of the position of the object.
