Matter is all the stuff, objects and substances that surround us.
It has volume and mass therefore it can be detected or measured.
You can see, feel, smell or see it with a microscope if it is like an invisible gas or dust mites.
We can identify or classify matter by its properties, both
1.
Physical properties: you can see it but it does not change the identity of the matter like density, ductibility, malleability, solubility..etc.
2.
Chemical properties: that can change the matter into a new kind of matter
Energy is a property of matter, and all matter has it.
It can be transferred from one object or system to another but it cannot be created or destroyed.
There are three kinds of energy:
1.mechanical energy=because of the objects motion or position
2. kinetic energy=because the object it moving
3. potential energy=because of its position or shape
