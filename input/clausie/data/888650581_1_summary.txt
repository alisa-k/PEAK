These few paragraphs talk about matter and what it is throughout everything, which is everything that takes up space, having volume, and mass.
We can detect it using our five senses and our technology, such as the microscope.
Matter is divided into two properties, which are physical and chemical.
The physical property does not change in substance, but physically changes, leaving what it is as it is; while the chemical property is the change in matter completely from its original substance.
Then there is energy, which all matter carries, has with them.
One example is the mechanical energy which is of an object in its position or in motion.
One known rule about energy is the law of conservation of energy, which states that, energy is neither cheated nor destroyed.
