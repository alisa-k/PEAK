Matter is important to society because not only does it build the building blocks of life.
It is all around us.
Whether it's an animal, or a bee that we can feel, it's also in the air.
There are tiny little gas particles that we cannot see, but they're there.
Energy can also be a property of matter because energy is not something you can see or touch, just like the gas particles.
