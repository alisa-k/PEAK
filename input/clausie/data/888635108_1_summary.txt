Matter is everything that has a volume and mass which means that all matters take up space and has a certain amount of material in them.
All matters have some kinds of properties which are the physical and chemical properties.
Physical properties are the properties of matter that can be changed without changing its make-up or identity.
And chemical that is about matters change to a new kind of matter.
All matters change through a physical or chemical change.
Which changes the physical and chemical properties of the matter.
Like cutting a piece of paper which is physical or burning it which makes it into ashes and carbon dioxide and that is a chemical change.
Within each of these changes the energy of matter is changing to another way.
All matters have energy in them and it's a property of matter.
The energy of matters can not be destroyed or created.
It only is changing to other kinds of energy.
This is called the law of conservation of energy.
The energy is all matters also has different styles each as mechanical energy which is the energy in moving parts of matter which is called kinetic and the energy an object has because of it, position and its called potential energy.
