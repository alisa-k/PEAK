In this passage I was taught very important objectives that are very important in the every day science.
These important objectives are matter, law of conservation, physical and chemical change, and mechanical energy.
Matter is what everything is build around.
It has every organism possibly made.
When we use matter we are using all the energies that are used.
Physical and chemical energy are energies and not has a different shape and volume.
Mechanical energy is when a object moves on repositions themselves, an example is when lifting a object to another spot.
The last is law of of conservation which specifically states that energy (by any means possible) cannot be destroyed at all.
