All objects have matter.
Matter is anything that takes up space.
All matter has volume and mass.
These characteristics make matter measurable.
Along with matter comes different properties.
The properties of matter make matter easier to classify.
There are both physical and chemical properties of matter.
Physical properties don't change the identity of the object, while chemical properties change the object into a whole new object with different properties.
Physical changes alter only the objects size and shape, but a chemical change produces a totally new substance.
Energy is another property of matter, and all matter contains energy.
Energy is transferrable.
It can be transferred from one object to another, but cannot be created or destroyed.
This is known as the law of conservation of energy.
There are three different types of energy.
Kinetic, which is the energy a moving object carries, potential, which is the energy an object carries because of it's shape, and mechanical energy, which is energy an object has resulting from its shape or position.
