Matter is what the universe is made of.
It contains many substances, one includes energy.
Matter is detected by the space it takes up and the volume it contains.
The reason why we can be sure what is matter is because we can see it or feel it.
The difference between physical and chemical is that physical can be observed without being changed and chemical must be changed around.
A substance that is contained in matter and must be contained is energy.
