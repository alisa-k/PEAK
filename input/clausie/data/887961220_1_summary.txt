Matter is something an object is made up.
All matter has energy.
Matter in an object can be changed when it happens by a chemical change.
A physical change only makes and object look a different way.
All objects have mechanical energy because of the motion it has or the position its in.
Kinetic energy is energy that is passed from one object to another.
