Matter is something that has volume, mass and energy, no matter how small it is.
We can see or smell and tough many matters around us, but there many more things that we cant, like viruses that are too small for us to see them with naked eyes, but they are there.
Matters can change in two ways: physical and chemical.
When a matter changes physical it just looses it shape but not the structure of it's atoms or molecules.
When a matter changes chemically, its atoms and molecules changes too, so we are going to have new materials.
