To go right to it, matter is everything.
When I say everything, I mean it.
That includes humans and the world.
And yes, if ever needed to measure this "matter", it can be done due to that it has volume and mass.
It has also been known that energy is a property of matter.
The substance has been known to even have its own law, and it is called law of conservation of energy.
What this mean is energy can travel and be transferred to another energy, but it cannot be created and destroyed.
