What is the difference between physical and chemical change?
Physical change is a change where the subject and shape changes, but the chemical is still there.
For example if you fold a piece of paper into thirds, your left with a piece of paper one third the size of the original.
The paper looks different but it still a physical change.
A chemical change is when the chemical properties of the paper have changes, producing a new substance.
