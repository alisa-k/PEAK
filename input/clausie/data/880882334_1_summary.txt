Matter is something is something that all objects and subjects has and it can be seen or feel or touch or even smell.
Matter has mass and volume.
We have two different type of matter properties: chemical and physical properties.
Physical property will only change the shape of the matter but will not change the identity of that matter.
Chemical property changes the shape and identity of the original matter to another new matter.
Energy not like matter can be seen or touch but its part of the matter.
All matter has energy.
The law of conservation of energy is that energy can be transferred from one object to other but cannot be created or destroyed.
Mechanical energy is an object has so it can move or stop in an place.
