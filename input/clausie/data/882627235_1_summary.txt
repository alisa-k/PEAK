This passage talks about matter and the properties it contains.
Matter is what everything in this universe is composed of.
Since matter has both volume and mass it can be disected and measured.
Some matter can be easily observed with our senses while others cannot.
Properties such as physical and chemical properties can help us classify matter.
Physical properties can be observed without changing the identity of matter.
Chemical properties describe matter based on its ability to change with different properties.
When the physical properties of an object change a physical change has occurred.
Although this change has occurred, its chemical properties are the same.
When the chemical properties change a chemical change has occurred.
Energy is a property of matter, therefore all matter has it.
Even though energy can be transferred from one object to another, it can't be destroyed or created.
This is known as the law of conservation of energy.
Energy has many different forms.
Mechanical energy is made of kinetic and potential energy.
