Matter is all around us.
If someone was to do a simple math problem on a piece of paper, that person would be surrounded by matter.
It is in the seat that he or she sits in, the pencil, paper, eraser, and table.
When one thinks about it matter is amazing; matter is what all objects and substances in the universe are made out of.
But there are two different properties to matter, the physical and chemical properties.
A physical property is something that can be observed without changing the make-up, or identity of the matter.
A chemical property is something that describes matter based on its ability to be changed into a new type of matter with different properties.
Energy is a property of matter and all matter has it.
But energy isn't something one could see or feel.
Energy has different forms that it comes in, but energy can never be created or destroyed, only transferred or lost.
There are three different kinds of energy, and they are; mechanical energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy.
