All objects contain matter.
Matter is.
The "stuff" in which all objects are made up of.
We can figure out matter by its volume and mass.
Matter can be classified by physical and chemical properties of an object.
The difference between a physical and chemical change is that a physical change, changes the outside of an object and a chemical change, changes everything it contained

Energy is in all matter and in all objects.
Energy can be transferred from one object to the next but it cannot be destroyed or changed.
That is the law of conservation of energy.
There is one types of energy mechanical energy is which the energy an object contains in its position or motion.
