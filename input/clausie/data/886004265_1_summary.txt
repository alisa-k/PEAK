			Matter: A Fact of Everyday Life
Matter is anything that occupies space and can be perceived by our senses.
We classify it by its physical or chemical properties.
It can be changed physically channging its shape but it is still made of the same substance.
If we change it chemically, we alter its form by changing its substance into a different substance.
Energy is also a property of matter and all matter has it.
It can not be created or destroyed although it can be transferred from one object to another.
