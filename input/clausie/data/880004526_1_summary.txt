Matter is everything that is in our universe.
It contains both volume and mass.
You can see some matter around you, but some you cannot.
Since they can be very very small, you can use microscopes.
We can classify matter by putting things into four properties: physical or chemical change.
Now physical change and chemical are different because physical is the outside appearance of an object.
Chemical is a substance change inside of something.
Energy is made up of all matter, but you cannot see it with only eyes.
But energy can never be created or destroyed.
Mechanical energy is different because this is the motion and position.
Physical change become of shape and position.
Everything we see and do physically and eventually has energy in it although we cannot see them, we feel then in our everyday activties.
