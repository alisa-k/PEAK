Everything is made up of matter.
You can detect a matter by feeling, smelling, and seeing.
All matter consists of two properties which is chemical and physical.
Chemical properties is when there's a new substance and physical properties is when the texture like the size and shape changes.
Every matter has energy, but you can never see or touch it.
There is kinetic energy and potential energy.
The energy an object has when it's moving is called the kinetic energy.
And the energy an object has in position is called potential energy.
We are always surrounded by matter.
And will always be.
