Matter is what the universe is made out of.
It takes up space measured in volume and it contains material measured in mass.
You can detect matter with your senses.
For example see, touch and smell.
Although matter takes up space, not all matter can be seen with the naked eye, such as the air that surrounds us and gases.
Not all matter is the same, properties of matter are used to identify or classify the kind of matter it is.
There are two types of matter.
Physical properties are the ones that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter.
Chemical properties which can change its identity (new kind of matter).
For example a lite cigar with physical properties the matter keeps its original characteristic but with chemical properties it changes into a new kind of matter.
