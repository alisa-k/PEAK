Matter is the stuff that all objects and substances in the universe are made of.
It can be detected and measured because of its volume and mass.
Properties is what help to identify or classify matter, which is base on the size the, shape and the sight.
Matter contain both physical properties and chemical properties.
Physical properties which can be observed without changing identity, of the matter which chemical properties are matter that change based on its ability changes into a new kind of matter with different properties which describe physical and chemical changes one of he properties of matter is energy it not something you can see or touch.
The law of conservation of energy us that energy cannot be created or destroyed while transferring from one system to another.
Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of its motion or position.
Two kind mechanical energy are kinetic energy which is the energy that cause the object to make and potential is the energy an object has because of its position or shape.
The greater the speed of mass a object is the greater the kinetic energy.
