Matter is the "stuff" that all object and substances in the universe are mad of.
Because all matter takes up space (has volume) and contains a certain amount of material (has mass), all matter can be detected and measured.
You can observe some types of matter easily with your senses.
For example, rocks, trees, bicycles, other types of matter are a little more difficult to observe.
For example, air.
If you fold a sheet of paper into third, you're left with a piece of paper one third the size of the original.
But the newly folded paper is still paper.
Such a change is called a physical change.
If you hold a lit match to the paper, the paper will burn.
What you're left with- ash gases, and smoke-is no longer paper.
This kind of change is called a chemical change.
Energy is a property of matter, and all matter has it.
Whenever a light bulb is lit, a san spins, or a fire burns, you can be sure that energy in one form or another made it happen.
Energy comes in many different forms.
While it can be transferred from one object or system to another, energy cannot be created or destroyed.
This rule is known as the law of conservation of energy.
Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of its motion or position.
There are two kinds of mechanical energy: kinetic and potential.
