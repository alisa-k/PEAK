This information was about matter.
Matter is any object that has mass and volume.
Matter has two properties, each are physical and chemical.
The difference between physical and chemical change is that chemical change produce a new substance.
Another property of matter is energy.
Some forms of energy are law of conservation, mechanical energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy.
Law of conservation of energy cannot be created or destroyed while transferring an object to another.
Mechanical energy is when the object gets energy from its motion or position.
Kinetic energy is the energy given to an object while moving potential energy is the energy a object gets by its position or shape.
