Matter is the "stuff" that thing are made of.
It can be measured and detected, because all matter has mass or volume.
Matter is classified by its properties, for example physical properties and chemical properties.
A physical change is when something has changed its size, shape, form but not chemically it is still the same substance.
A chemical change has changed its properties, it is no longer what it was before.
Energy is a property of matter, it is not created nor destroyed.
