All things around us are matter.
They all have mass and volume.
All matter has different kind of properties that helps us detect and classify them, these properties are categorized in chemical and physical.
Physical properties are the ones that are related to the appearance of matter and not to its composition.
Chemical properties are those which can be observed when composition of matter alters and new form of substances form.
Another property of matter is energy which cannot be seen or touched like matter.
Energy has different types and forms and they can turn into each other.
Mechanical energy is a kind of energy that matter has it because of its motion or position that has, mechanical energy is divided into 2 kinds 1st kinetic energy which is the kind that objects has because they have speed and the 2nd type is potential that is the type that object has it because the of the position they have.
Corrected: All matter has different properties that helps us detect and classify them
Corrected: energy has different types and it can change from one kind to other forms.
Corrected: mechanical energy is a kind of energy that matter has because of it motion or position
