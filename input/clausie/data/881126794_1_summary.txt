Matter is everywhere, everything contains matter.
There are two different properties which are physical and chemical.
Physical can be observed without changing the identity or matter.
Chemical properties describes matter that can change into a new kind of matter with different properties.
Energy is also a property of matter.
There are three types of energy: mechanical, kinetic and potential.
Mechanical energy is what energy an object has because of motion.
Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because it ismoving.
Potential energy is the energy because of an objects position.
