After reading the passage it taught me about what matter is and anything that is involved with matter.
Matter is the "stuff" that all subjects and substances in the universe are made of.
Also matters takes up space (has volume) and contains a certain amount of material (has matter) all matter can be detected and measured.
Properties helps us identify or classify matter.
There is physical change which is when objects make a change that does not change their chemical nature.
Another change would be chemical which is when ever there is a rearrangement of atoms that makes or breaks chemical bonds.
Ex.
Of each would be physical fold a paper any way it's still a physical change because the size and shape change.
For chemical change it is burning a paper.
Energy is another main part of matter because energy is a property of matter, and all matter has energy.
Energy comes in different forms.
It can be transformed from one object to another, energy cannot be created or destroyed, this the law of conservation of energy.
Than comes mechanical energy, it is the energy of an object has because of it's motion or position.
There are two kinds kinetic and potential energy.
Kinetic is a energy of an moving object.
Potential is an energy an object of its position and shape.
