Matter is all the stuff the universe is made of.
All matter can be detected and measured because it has volume and mass.
Properties help classify matter.
The difference between a physical and chemical change is that physical changes its size and shape whereas chemical changes its chemical make-up.
Energy and matter are related because energy is a property of matter and all matter has it.
The law of conservation of energy is that matter can be transferred but not destroyed.
Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of its motion or position.
