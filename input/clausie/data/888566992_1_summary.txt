Matter is everything.
There are different kinds of matter, like trees that you can touch and see.
Others you can't, like atoms and gas.
Some matter is made of molecules in the wood.
Whether or not it can be shaped to another piece, or if it crumbles, is an example of properties.
A physical change is like a cube of ice being crushed to smaller pieces.
It's still a solid piece of frozen water.
A chemical change is like when grapes ferment and turn into alcoholic wine.
It's properties are no different.
All matter has energy.
It can be transferred from one thing to another but it can't be destroyed.
This is the law of conservation of energy.
Kinetic energy is energy matter has because it's moving.
The harder you throw an object the fast it'll move.
Potential energy is energy due to shape and position.
A pointed end might move faster through the air.

2.
The harder you throw an object, the faster..
