Matter is the "stuff" that everything is made of.
It has volume and mass.
Which is why it can be detected and measured.
Matter has two different properties physical and chemical.
They help to classify the matter.
While physical is easy to change by riping or breaking something its a bit harder to change the chemical properties.
All matter has energy.
And it can be transferred from one object to another but it cannot be created or destroyed.
Mechanical energy is created by its motion and position.
