Matter is what everything is made up of.
You can see it cause it does have a physical being.
But somethings are too small to see with the naked eye like dust under your couch.
To classify matter you do test on it like weighing it out or putting it in water which tells us the properties of matter.
The physical properties of matter are like taking a piece of clay and squeezing it.
It will take a different form but what its made up of will not change.
A physical change is what it looks like a chemical change is what it is actually made up of.
The reading tells us there is a thing called law of conservation of energy and it means that energy can be transferred from one object or system to another.
Energy cant be created or destroyed.
Mechanical energy is energy an object that has because of its motion or position.
