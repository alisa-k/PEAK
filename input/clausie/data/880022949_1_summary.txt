Matter is something that every thing is made of.
It can be detected and measured because all matter contains material and takes up space.
Different characteristics help classify matter, they are called properties.
There are physical and chemical changes in matter.
It changes physically when the size and shape has changed.
When matter changes into a different matter (paper into fire), it is a chemical change.
Energy is a property of matter, all matter has energy.
You can't see or touch energy like you can with matter.
The law of conservation or energy states that energy can be transferred but not created or destroyed.
Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of it's motion or position.
Kinetic and potential are two kinds of mechanical energy.
An object in motion creates kinetic energy.
Energy an object has because of its position or shape is potential.
