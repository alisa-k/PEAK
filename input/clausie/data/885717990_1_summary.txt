Matter is the "stuff" that an object takes place.
Meaning the space taken by the object.
All matter can be measured because it takes up space.
Then we have the physical and chemical change.
A physical change is a change in the way an object appears an chemical change is when the object changes shape.
Energy and matter are very closely related because energy is mainly made up of matter.
