Matter is all objects and substances in the universe are made of.
Because all matter takes up space and contains a certain amount of material all matter can be detected and measured.
You can observe some types of matter easily with your senses.
For example, you can smell coooked food and see cooked food.
Physical properties are those that can be observed without changing the make-up for identity of the matter.
