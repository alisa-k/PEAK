Matter is everywhere, materials, substances that our universe is made of.
It has volume, mass, and can be detected and measured.
Matter can be observed with the human senses; we can see it with the naked eye, feel it, or smell it.
The matter that is impossible to see unless it can be observed with a microscope.
Matter has three characteristics that help to classify matter as follows;
1.
Physical properties like density, malleability, and ductility.
The physical property takes place when it can be observed without changing identity of the matter.
2.
Chemical properties happen when matter has ability to change into a new kind of matter with different properties, such as flammability, reaction to acid and water.
3.
Energy that you can't see or touch is a third property of matter that all matter has it.
It's a capacity of matter.
According to the law of conservation of energy, the energy cannot be created or destroyed which is transformed from one object (system) to another.
Forms of energy->mechanical energy the motion position of an object->kinetic energy (an object in motion, is moving) the greater the speed of the object, the greater its kinetic energy.
->potential energy (an object has energy because of its position, shape).
