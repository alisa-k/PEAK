The "stuff" that all objects in the universe have is matter.
Matter can be measured and detected because it has volume and mass.
Many different properties, like shape or size, help to classify matter.
Energy and matter are related because all matter has energy stored.
Physical change is the change is size or shape.
Chemical change is when a new substance appears.
When energy can be transferred from one object to another but not created or destroyed it is called the law of conservation of energy.
Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of its motion or position.
