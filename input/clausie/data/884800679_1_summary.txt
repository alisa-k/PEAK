Matter is what all objects and substances in the universe are made of.
Due to its mass and volumes matter is able to be detected and measured.
Now in order to see things that the naked eye can't, we use a microscope in detecting things like matter.
The properties of matter are physical and chemical.
The physical property are those that can be observed without changing the make-up or identity.
The chemical property deals with the ability to change into a new kind of matter with different properties.
Physical change is when we change the size and shape of an object, and chemical change is when an object changes to a new substance.
Energy, like matter, is present in all things as a component of matter; except, we can't see or touch it.
The law conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transferred from one object or system to another.
Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of its motion or position, and potential energy deals with the position and shape of an object.
