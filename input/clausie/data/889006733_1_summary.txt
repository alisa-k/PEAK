The universe is large compared to earth, but the things we find on earth can be as big and greater.
Matter is in all the things we see on earth.
Matter has to have a shape meaning mass and volume; even air that we breath has matter.
We humans have played with matter and mixed elements to create new compounds; these compounds have chemical and physical changes.
The matter can change physically with shape and the energy that cannot be broken or destroyed meaning it has a position or in motion.
