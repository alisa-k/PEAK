Matter is the "stuff" that makes up all the stuff in the universe.
All matter can be detected and measured because all matter is made up of volume and mass.
It can easily be detected by your senses because it is visible and touchable.
Matter has physical and chemical properties.
Physical change can be observed without changing the identity of the matter.
Chemical change allows matter to change into a different matter with different properties.
Energy is a property of matter and all matter has it.
Energy can not be created or destroyed, the law of conservation of energy states that.
Mechanical energy is made up of 2 specific energies.
Kinetic energy states that an object has energy because its moving.
Potential energy says an object has energy because of its shape and position.
