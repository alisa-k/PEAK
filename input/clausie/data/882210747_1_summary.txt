Matter is mainly everything we can see, touch, smell, feel.
It is everything around us.
All matter has volume or mass which is helpful for us to define it.
When defining matter it can be classified by looking at the properties of matter.
There are two properties of matter.
They are physical and chemical.
Therefore when physical and chemical change happens one thing is changed but when it is physical change it only changes physically and keeps on been the same thing, but when it is chemical it changes from one thing to become something different.
There is also a third property of matter; this property is energy.
Energy can be transferred but it cannot be made up or destroyed.
One form of energy is mechanical energy which is the force a thing has according to its position or towards what direction it is moving.
Mechanical energy has two kind of energy: they are potential which means the energy based on position and shape of the object and kinetic is the energy a moving object has.
