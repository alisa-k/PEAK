Matter is the stuff that all objects and substances in the universe are made of.
All matter can be detected and measured because they all has volume and mass.
Your senses play a big role in helping you classify matter.
Physical properties are those that can be observed without changing the make-up of matter.
Chemical properties describe matter based on its ability to change into a new kind of matter with different properties.
Energy and matter are related because energy is a property of matter, and all matter has it.
Energy can be transferred from one object or system to another, but cannot be created or destroyed.
Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of its motion or position.
