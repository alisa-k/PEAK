Everything we see around us is made up of matter.
From a simple bicycle to a dust particle, they both have volume and mass.
All matter has different properties that distinguish themselves from one another.
These properties may either be physical or chemical properties.
Physical properties is when the identity of the object doesn't change.
While, a chemical property is when the object changes its appearance into a new kind of matter.
There are two types of changes involved in matter.
The first is a physical change which is only a change in size and shape.
However, a chemical change is where new substances are produced.
Another property that is found in matter is energy.
The three different forms of energy, ar emechanical, kinetic, and potential.
All three can be transferred but they are not created or destroyed.
