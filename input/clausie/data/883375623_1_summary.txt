There are three states of matter.
Solid, liquids, and gases .
That are all different states of matter.
Each of these states is also known as a phase.
Elements and compounds can move from one phase to another phase when special phhysical forces are present.
One example of these forces is temperature.
The phase or state of matter can change when temperature changes.
Generally, as the temperature rises, matter moves to a more active start.
Phase describes a physical state of matter.
The key word to notice is physical.
Things only move from one phase to another by physical means.
If energy is added or energy is taken away you have created a physical change.
