What is matter?
Matter is substances and materials that make-up the universe.
Using your senses, it is not difficult to detect matter.
Because certain matter takes up space and has a certain amount of material.
Then comes the physical change and chemical change.
Physical change is when the size and shape of the physical property changes.
Then chemical change is when it produces new substances.
And energy is important to matter because all matter contains and needs energy.
The law of conservation of energy is when energy cannot be created or destroyed.
Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of its motion or position.
