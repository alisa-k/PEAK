What is matter?
Everything in this planet and all the universe is made of matter, for example a cell phone, car, tree, ocean, everything.
Matter takes up space (has different volume) and contains certain amount or mass of material.
All matter has different kinds of properties, like the size, shape, color, anything that identifies or classifies the object.
Matter has two types of changes, physical and chemical change.
In physical change, the substance stays the same but the properties changes into different shape, size, or appearance.
Chemical change, changes the substance into new substance, like when a paper is burn into ashes.
Energy is one of the properties of matter and all matter has it.
Energy is not something that can be touched or seen, it happens when heating occurs, a motion or something put things in shape.
One thing for sure, energy can be transferred from one object to another, and it cannot be created or destroyed, this is a rule called the law of conservation of energy.
There's two kinds of mechanical energy, kinetic and potential energy.
Kinetic energy is energy an object has because it is moving.
Potential energy is energy an object has because of it's position, size and shape.
