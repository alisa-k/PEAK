Matter is what makes up the universe and for themost part is anything tangible.
Energy is related to matter and these two go hand in hand.
For example, a ball knocking over a bottle, the ball and bottle would be matter and the ball causing the bottle to fall over would be the energy.
Even though  energy cannot be created nor destroyed it can however be transferred, and there are different types of energy.
