Matter is what we're surround by.
Everyday trees, rocks, buildings, etc.
We observe them without noticing sometimes.
They have an affect on us because we know what we get from them.
Like we receive oxygen from trees we use rocks as landscape stone for house and building are important place people go to for certain things.
Like grocery store, dentist, post office, toy stores.
Matter is also a substance that are people, jobs like at retail stores anything that is flammable like propane tanks.
