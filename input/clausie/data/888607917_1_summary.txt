Matter is the objects and substances the universe is made of; it is made of volume and mass.
You can see matter any where in your daily life.
For example; cars, lamps, beds, and balloons.
Other types of matter is microscopic.
Meaning you can't see with the naked eye; like dust mites.
To help identify and classify matter is called properties.
Recent studies have shown different types of matter.
For instance a egg and wood.
The wood weighs more than the egg, but put to the water test the egg sinks but the wood floats.
Chemical properties is matter based on its ability to change into a new kind of matter with different properties into a new kind of matter with different properties.
Basically saving chemical properties changes matters appearance.
Matter also has energy in its properties.
Like a drum; stereo, radios, light bulbs.
