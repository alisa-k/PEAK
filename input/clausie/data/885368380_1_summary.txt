What is matter?
My own definition of matter is any object that has an indefinite volume and mass.
All matter can be detected and measured even if it cannot be seen.
Everyday you witness physical changes, and chemical changes; from you car's metal oxidating little by little to, people smoking those cigarettes.
Physical change is any form of matter changing shape.
Where as chemical change is any matter morphing into another substance.
To be able to do such a radical change energy is needed.
Energy can neither be destroyed nor created.
