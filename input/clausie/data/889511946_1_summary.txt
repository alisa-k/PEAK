Matter is the "stuff" that all objects and substances are made of.
Matter can be detected and measured because all matter takes up space and contains a limited amount of matrerial.
Properties help us identify matter.
A physical change is when matter changes its shape and features.
A chemical change is when matter takes up a new form entirely and becomes a new entity.
Energy is also a property of matter, and all matter has it.
The law of conservation states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but it can be transferred from one object or system to another.
Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of its motion or position.
There are two different kinds of mechanical energy: kinetic and potential.
Kinetic energy is the energy a moving object has.
Potential energy is energy an object has because of its position or shape.
