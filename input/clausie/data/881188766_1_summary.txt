This world is made up of many different things.
One of which is matter.
All matter has volume and mass, therefore it can be detected and measured.
Matter also has both chemical and physical properties.
Chemical properties describe matter based on its ability to change into a new kind of matter with different properties.
Physical properties are those that can be observed without changing the make-up, or identity, of the matter.
Another important topic is energy.
There is the law of conservation energy, mechanical energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy.
The law of conservation energy is when it can be transferred to one object or another, energy cannot be created or destroyed.
