Matter is an important part of our lives.
If we didn't have matter we wouldn't have all these object in the world.
We know this because all matter makes up space (has volume) and contains a certain amount of material (has mass) that why we can detect it.
Matter allows us to be able to touch and see rocks, trees, bicycles, and different types of animals.
We can also smell it like smoke from a fire.
The air is also considered to be matter but its hard to detect because it cannot be seen.
But we know it exists because when the wind blows we see the tree branches bend.
Properties of matter help us to classify matter.
All matter has both physical properties and chemical properties.
You can observe physical properties without changing the make-up or identity, of the matter.
But chemical property can change its identity.
More over, energy is a property of matter, and all matter has it.
Even though it is hard to detect it because it can't be seen or touched.
In one form or another if it happened energy was the cause of it.
