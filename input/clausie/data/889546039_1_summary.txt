Matter is the stuff that all objects and substances are made of.
All matter can be measured and detected.
Matter has properties physical and chemical which can produce changes to matter.
A pysical property is the one that has the ability to change into a new kind of matter with different properties.
Energy is another property of matter and all matter has it.
Energy cannot be seen or touched, this property of matter can be transferred from one object or system to another but cannot be created or destroyed.
This is a rule that is known as the law of conservation of energy.
Energy comes in different forms, example mechanical energy is the energy that comes from an object by its motion or position.
Mechanical energy comes in two kinds kinetic and potential.
Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because its shape or position.
Matter comes with energy is very different forms.
