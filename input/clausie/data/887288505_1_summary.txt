Matter makes up everything we know in the universe.
Matter has different properties, physical and chemical.
Physical changes do not change the make-up of the substance but chemical changes do.
Energy is one property of matter, and it has many different forms.
One of the forms/types is mechanical energy.
Mechanical energy is energy that an object has because of its position.
One of the most important laws of energy is the law of conservation of energy.
It says that energy cannot be destroyed or created, but it can only be transferred.
