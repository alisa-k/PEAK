Matter is the "stuff" that makes up all objects or substances in the universe.
Matter has two different types of properties, physical and chemical.
A physical reaction of matter is something that happens without messing with the chemical property of the matter.
This means that a chemical change is not just changing the physical property but altering its structure with another chemical.
All matter contains energy, and some matter needs energy to run.
There are three different ways to release energy; mechanical, kinetic and potential.
Mechanical energy depends of the position or [illegible word] of the matter.
Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because it is moving.
Potential energy is the energy an object has because of its position or shape.
I gained from this passage a little more insight as to how energy works and operates.
