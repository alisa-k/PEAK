Matter is made up of everything.
Everything you have, feel, or see is made up of matter.
Everything has energy to.
There is a lot of things that has to do with matter.
Physical and chemical changes.
The law of conservation of energy is when energy is transferred from object to another, energy cannot be created nor destroyed.
And kinetic energy is an energy an object has when it's moving.
This is what I think is the most important things in this passage.
