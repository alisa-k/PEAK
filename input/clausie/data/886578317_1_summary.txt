Matter is the stuff that all objects and substances in the universe are made of.
Because all matter has space and mass it can be detected and measured.
You can observe some types of matter easily because of your senses.
The difference between a physical and chemical change is that a physical change is where an object can change without change what it is or what you started with.
And a chemical change changes the object to another making it different from what you started with.
