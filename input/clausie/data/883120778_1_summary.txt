The passage I have just read focuses on matter and other element that have to do with matter.
Matter is substances of which any physical object is made.
In other words matter is what everything is made of.
Matter can be measured and detected because it contains a certain amount of material which takes up space matter can be classified in many ways.
There is many ways to classify matter.
An example is a cork and clay.
If you drop both objects into water the cork will float, but the clay on the otherhand would.
That is one way you can classify matter.
Every object can have a physical or chemical change.
For example, if you break a pencil in two you change the size and shape but not what is made of.
A chemical change is if you burn paper, the paper turnsinto ashes, and smoke it is no longer paper.
Energy is heated to matter, because matter contains energy and is a property of matter.
Matter contains certain amount of material that takes up space which can be measured and detected.
