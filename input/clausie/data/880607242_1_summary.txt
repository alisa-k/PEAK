Matte is the one thing that all objects and substances in the universe are made of.
We cannot detected and measured it because is invisible to the human eye.
A microscope is the only tool that can help us classify it.
There are two kinds of properties that each of them have a difference.
That is that physical change is one that does not change even if its observed because is a malleable properties of matter, the other one is chemcail changes that describes matter based on its ability to change into a new kind of matter with different kind of properties.
Matter and energy are related because energy is a property of matter and always has it.
The law of conservation of energy is energy that can be transformed from one object or system to another energy that cannot be created or destroyed.
Mechanical energy is energy, an object has because of its motion or position.
