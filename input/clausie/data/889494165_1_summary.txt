Matter is the stuff that all the objects around us are created of.
Characteristics that help us to identify the matter are properties.
There are two kinds of properties, physical and chemical properties, there are also two kinds of changes that happen to matter physical and chemical.
Energy is a property of matter, and matter has it.
Energy cannot be created or destroyed and that's called the law of conservation of energy.
Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of it's motion or position.
Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because it is moving.
Potential energy is an energy an object has because of it's position or shape.
