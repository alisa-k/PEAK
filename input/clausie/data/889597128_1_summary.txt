				Matter
Matter are items that objects and substances in our environment and our surroundings contain.
We are able to detect and measure all matter because it takes up space and contains a certain amount of material.
Some types of matter are observed under a microscope.
The properties and characteristics help us classify matter.
Their are two types of changes in matter; physical, which refers to size and shape and chemical which refers to a new substance.
In the universe, all matter contains energy.
Others forms of energy are mechanical, kinetic, and potential energy.
The law that is followed is known as "Law of Conversation of Energy," which states while it can be transferred from one object or system to another, energy cannot be created or destroyed.
