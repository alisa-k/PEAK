Matter is what everything in the universe is made all of.
Not all matter can be seen or felt.
Sometimes it might be too small or transparent.
To help classify matter, matter has characteristics called properties.
For example: density, ductility, malleability, boiling point, melting point, electrical conductivity and solubility.
Matter has physical and chemical changes.
Physical change could be that you could shape it and put it back how it was.
Chemical, it changes but it doesn't go back to its original.
Matter can have energy because of how its positioned or at its motion.
Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
